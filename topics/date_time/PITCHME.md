### Date-Time API

- Package: java.time |
- Replaces Joda-Time |
- Immutable types |
- Clock and Instant |
- Duration vs. Period |
- LocalDateTime vs. ZonedDateTime vs. OffsetDateTime |

Note:
- Instead of ms since 1st Jan '70, it's now seconds and ns 
- LocalDateTime can't represent an Instant w/o timezone
- Duration is time-based, Period is date-based
